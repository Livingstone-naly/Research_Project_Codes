The codes are for the implementation of the newly derived EOIPM on some illustrative pyhsical models.
The "Stability_Function.ipynb" plots the stability region of the eighth-order inverse polynomial method.
The "Project_Numerical_Examples.ipynb" implements the code and compares the results to the famous Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg method (RKF45).
The "Project_Numerical_Examples.ipynb" also estimates the absolute errors generated via the EOIPM and the RKF45.
